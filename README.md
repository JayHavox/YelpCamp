Yelpcamp can be used to review campgrounds and add your own. 
This project is based off a course by Colt Steele where I learned mongo, express, node, javascript, html and css. 
Along with learning how to use passport for authentication and mapbox to create a clustermap. 
To seed the database use node seeds/index.js then if you are going to start the project up, use nodemon app.js in the terminal and localhost:3000 
Thank you
